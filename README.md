🧠 Next Word Prediction using RNN/LSTM/GRU
📌 Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop a language model that predicts the next word in a given sequence of text using RNN-based deep learning architectures such as LSTM or GRU. The project helps in understanding how sequential data is handled in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

💼 Business Use Cases
Text Autocompletion: Suggest next word in real-time in text editors.

Voice Assistants: Predict contextually accurate words to enhance transcription quality.

Search Engines: Auto-complete search queries faster and more accurately.

Machine Translation & Chatbots: Foundation for encoder-decoder architectures used in translation and dialogue systems.
